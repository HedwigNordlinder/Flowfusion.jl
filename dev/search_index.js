During inference, the conditioning mask (and conditioned-upon state) has to be present onX1`. This dictates the behavior of the masking:\n\nWhen bridge() is called, the mask, and the state where cmask=1, are inherited from X1.\nWhen gen() is called, the state and mask will be propogated from X0 through all of the Xts.\n\nLoss mask behavior:\n\nWhere lmask=0, that observation (where the shape/size of the observation is determined by the difference in dimensions between the mask and the state) is not included in the loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Flowfusion.apply_tangent_coordinates-Tuple{ForwardBackward.ManifoldState, Any}","page":"Home","title":"Flowfusion.apply_tangent_coordinates","text":"apply_tangent_coordinates(Xt::ManifoldState, ξ; retraction_method=default_retraction_method(Xt.M))\n\nreturns X̂₁ where each point is the result of retracting Xt by the corresponding tangent coordinate vector ξ.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Flowfusion.batch-Union{Tuple{Vector{T}}, Tuple{T}} where T<:ForwardBackward.ContinuousState","page":"Home","title":"Flowfusion.batch","text":"batch(Xs::Vector{T}; dims_from_end = 1)\n\nDoesn't handle padding.
